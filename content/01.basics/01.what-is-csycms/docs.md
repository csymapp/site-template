## What is CSYCMS?

CSYCMS is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible**, file-based content management system, knowledge base and static site generator for nodejs. It uses static Markdown files to serve the content which is pulled from public/private repos in github, bitcket, gitlab or any other git repository management service. It runs services that enables it to auto update itself and the content it serves. It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, and allows you to use the structure of content files used in the [most popular flat file cms](https://getgrav.org) but in nodejs. In addition to this, it allows you to host several sites in one instance (installation) of it, and allows you to search across as many of your sites as you please. See more [features](#features).

The underlying architecture of CSYCMS is designed to use well-established and _best-in-class_ technologies. Some of these key technologies include:

* [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): for easy content creation
* [Hogan Templating](http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/): for powerful control of the user interface
* Microservices to make deployments of multiple sites more stable

If you decide to go further with csycms, then please also learn how to pronouce it well. In declaring and defining the word, we intended that it should be pronouced as would `psy CMS` if that `psy` was  from words such as `psychology` etc.

## CSYCMS' Place in the Universe

There are many powerful open source CMS solutions for building complex websites.  Some of the more commonly used ones are [Joomla](http://joomla.org), [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), and [Drupal](http://drupal.org). The downside of these platforms is that they have a steep learning curve associated with them. ***This requires a significant amount of your time - and this may be the time that you do not have when creating a website is not your main job.*** In our case we spent that time instead in building CSYCMS to make things easy for you.

These platforms provide a wealth of features and functionality that you can extend with a wide variety of open source and proprietary plug-ins and themes.  These extensions and themes are themselves often feature-packed, requiring more knowledge and time on the part of the developer yet. In the end, you often find yourself creating a website that requires many plugins and extensions from many different vendors. This can make your design overly complicated and difficult to maintain over the long term.

CSYCMS tackles the problem differently.  It focuses primarily on your content and turns your content structure into a navigable site. This make it easy for developers, engineers, etc to write documentations for their work, creating a knowledge base that can be referred to in after years by them or by others who take up their positions. This is what CSYCMS is designed to do. How easy is it? As easy as writing a `README.md` for github, gitlab, etc..

That it is written in nodejs means that further work can be done in it to bring it up to the level of other complex CMSes written in other languages

Its installation process is simple and it's update process even simpler, being automated. To get a basic site up-and-running requires minimal Web development experience. To create content for the site requires only a knowledge of markdown.

## Features

That csycms can compare with wordpress & co, we do not pretend. But it is flat file and they are not. And that csycms can compare with grav we do not pretend either. But it is nodejs and it is not. And with csycms you get extra features by which reasonable justification is found for its use and development.
### Common features
- Markdown for easy content creation

### Unique features
- Different themes for different files
- Several sites in a single installation (Like in shared hosting), making maintenance very easy.
- Search across multiple sites
- Auto-update of itself, the sites and the themes.
- Pulls sites content from github/gitlab/bitbucket, etc.
- Microservices (not in the scrictest sense of the word) to make deployments of multiple sites more stable
- Upto 4 levels in menu

### Other advantages
- Very easy to learn.
